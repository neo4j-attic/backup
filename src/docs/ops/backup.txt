Backup
======

Backups are performed over the network live from a running graph database onto a local copy.
There are two types of backup: full and incremental.

A _full backup_ copies the entire store files from the source database and is required in order to, at a later time, do an incremental backup.

An _incremental backup_ will only retrieve and apply the changes since the most recent full or incremental backup.
Because of that incremental backup is much more efficient than doing full backups every time.

[IMPORTANT]
Backups can only be performed on databases which have the configuration parameter `enable_online_backup=true` set.
That will make the backup service available on the default port (6362).
To enable the backup service on a different port use for example `enable_online_backup=port=9999` instead.

== Embedded and Server ==

To perform a backup from a running embedded or server database run:
[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup
./neo4j-backup -full -from 192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from 192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup where the service is registered on a custom port
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from 192.168.1.34:9999 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
----

== High Availability ==

To perform a backup on an HA cluster you specify one or more ZooKeeper services managing that cluster.
[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup from HA cluster, specifying two possible ZooKeeper services
./neo4j-backup -full -from-ha 192.168.1.15:2181,192.168.1.16:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup from HA cluster, specifying only one ZooKeeper service
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from-ha 192.168.1.15:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
----

== Restoring Your Data ==

The Neo4j backups are fully functional databases. To use a backup, all you need to do replace your database folder with the backup.
